## CBS Server
Our lab makes use of a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) server at Robarts,
so that all users can access the same graphical user interface on a Ubuntu 
Linux system with most of the software we make use of pre-installed. The system
can act as a remote replacement and can accessed from any machine in order to
visualize and interact with your data (including data on the Digital Alliance
of Canada servers).

{: .important}
Form for new user sign-up (**select Basic user unless you have discussed this with your supervisor(s)**): 
[https://forms.office.com/r/mdmWQ6qpep](https://forms.office.com/r/mdmWQ6qpep)

All Khanlab users will automatically be granted access to a CBS basic (standard)
account. Please contact Dr. Khan if you need a CBS heavy account (more 
computational resources).
