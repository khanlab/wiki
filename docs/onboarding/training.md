## Basic Training (HR)
WHMIS & Worker Health and Safety Awareness Training is required:
[](https://www.uwo.ca/hr/learning/required)

<!-- Need updated link here -->
## Lawson Training
This training is required for working with clinical data. See:
[TBD](#)

{: .note}
You will need to complete all the training and print copies of certificates &
completed quizzes (will be a large stack of paper!)

## Software Training
Our lab uses Python, BASH shell, MATLAB, R, git, and a number of other tools.
You can find some nice tutorials on the 
[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) website.

Below are some useful links for getting up to speed on some of the tools we use:
* [Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice)
* [Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice)
* [Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation)
* [Snakemake](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/workflows-snakemake/01-introduction/index.html)
* [Snakebids](https://snakebids.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)

## Educational Resources
As a lab, a lot of our research is focused on the use of magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and performing neuroimaging analyses. 

Below are some useful resources:
* [MRI](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-mri)
* Neuromaging analyses:
  * [Structural MRI](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-sMRI/)
  * [Diffusion MRI](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-dMRI/)
  * [Functional MRI](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-fMRI/)
* [Machine learning](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-novice-sklearn/)

Other useful readings include:
* Papers on topics related to your research project (pick a paper for a journal
club)
