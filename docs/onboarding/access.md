## Lab Location
Our lab is located in a secure, card-access building. Additionally, our lab is
behind a door that requires a key to unlock.

## UWO Identity
If you do not already have a UWO identity, you will need to contact [WTS](https://wts.uwo.ca/index.html)
(519-661-3800) to get your password - they will ask for your UWO ID#. 
You can then activate your identity 
[here](https://identity.uwo.ca/activate-hr;jsessionid=C843C01692B7B246356C75B4F1E2C9D4?0).

## Robarts Login
Our lab makes use of a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) server at Robarts, so that all users can access the same graphical user interface on a Ubuntu Linux system. 
To sign up for a user, fill out the following [form](https://forms.office.com/r/sQepNZDNqS). Please select basic user unless you have discussed this with your supervisor(s).

All Khanlab users will automatically be granted access to a CBS basic (standard) account. Please contact Dr. Khan if you need a CBS heavy account (more computational resources).

## Card Access
Your Western card should grant you access into the outer doors of Robarts. If 
you are unable to enter one of the secured doors using your card, you will need
to contact Rebecca Nash (rnash@robarts.ca) (cc: Ali Khan) with the following information:

* Name of person needing access
* Their employment relationship (Staff, Grad Student, Associated Persons)
* Email address of person needing access
* UWO ID # for person needing access (if available)
* Dates required for access (Start/End)
* Reason for access

{: .note}
If you forget your card at home or left it at your desk, you can also enter 
through the front doors (on the 2nd floor where security is located).

## Keys
There are two doors, both using the same key, that can be used to enter the lab: 
* By the atrium
* Through the halls by the men's washroom 

To request a key to the lab (RRI 1240), follow the steps 
[here](https://www.uwo.ca/fm/client_services/keys.html).

During the day, this door will be be unlocked. In the evening or if you are
the first to arrive, you may find this door locked.  If you are locked out of the Lab space and nobody is around, on-site Robarts security can let you in (if security is not at the Front Desk, they may be walking their rounds in the building and will return).
